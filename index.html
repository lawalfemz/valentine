            I find myself reflecting on the depth of my feelings for you and the immense care and love that fills my heart. i want to take this moment to express bjust how much you mean to me(i have not done this before), even if circumstances prevent me from getting you a valueable gift.
            Words cannot fully capture the extent of my love and appreciation for you. You have become the center of my world, and every day spent with you is a gift in itself. The way you light up my life with your presence, your smile, and your unwavering support is something I treasure deeply.
            i even get lost when staring at a picture of u tho which is lovely. sometimes when i just see a snap or text from u i just smile mi lady. funny how i want to express myself more than this, i love u tho, (fuck i am angry at myself i can't get u anything).
